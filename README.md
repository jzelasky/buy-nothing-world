# Buy Nothing World

## Description

Facebook buy nothing groups and the Craigslist free page are great resources if you're on a budget or trying to reduce your climate footprint. However, both are location dependent so if you live in a rural area there isn't a lot available. Buy Nothing World solves that problem. Users can share items they're getting rid of with people anywhere by coordinating shipping.
